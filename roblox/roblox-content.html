			<h2>About the Series</h2>
			<p>The Crappy Roblox Videos is my first major series I worked on with 
			collaborators using multiple old Roblox cilents and Revivals throughout 2017 to 2021. 
				The story focuses on <abbr title="Legodude50">LD50</abbr> and the meme thief, 
				Ledu50, as they roam around the revivals, and stop some cliche threat 
				from destroying them. A pretty crappy story indeed.</p>

				<h3>LC27's Roblox History</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="BB">	
				<p>I first discovered Roblox in the late 2010/early 2011 from an ad on a flash game site. 
					Since I'm a fan of Lego Bricks, I was impressed and got hooked. 
					I would play as a guest until creating my account somewhere on 4/20/2011. 
					From there on out, I would be creating memories until Roblox started to change 
					drastically by stripping away features to appease the investors and not the players.</p> 

				<p>In my honest opinion, Roblox truly went downhill in the year of 2016 during the 
					removal of Tix. Even though this decision was inevitable given Roblox's position, 
					on the bright side, older versions of the Roblox client were leaked 
					or became available to the public around the same time. This would lead others to 
					create the ‘Old Roblox Revivals’. That's a story for another day.</p>

				<p>Besides that, I would still play the game when I feel like it because from 
					a technical standpoint, Roblox does provide an engine to code and 
					create things. For the community aspect on the other hand, it is a mixed reception 
					for me. There’s the good, the bad, and the big head noob. 
					To quote a Simpsons character, "Don't forget: you're here forever."</p>

			<div class="BB">
				<p><b>Why does this series exist?</b>
				<br>
					Being bored one day, I found out about the old Roblox Revivals during late 2016/early 2017, and decided to start the Crappy Roblox Videos. 
					Throughout its lifespan, I would learn how to edit videos using Windows Live Movie Maker and VideoPad. Due to being limited on resources 
					at times, I would like to give a major "Thank You" to those involved and help me made this series possible. 
					<br>
					<br>
					While other Roblox series out there never got finished for various reasons, I decided to complete mines by giving it an ending.</p>
					<p><b>What Old Roblox revivals were used?</b>
					<br>
					Graphictoria, Finobe, & RBXLegacy/Novetus.</p>
					<p><b>What is Fracasotoria?</b>
					<br>
					Fracasotoria was a joke name used by Finobe during a conflict with Graphictoria back in 2017. It's a long story.</p>
